.SYNOPSIS
    Packages one release archive for harbor (Windows).

.DESCRIPTION
        scripts/package-release.ps1 -Target <triple> [-OutDir dist]

    writes

        dist/harbor-<target>.zip

    The archive holds exactly two entries, both at the top level: the binary
    (`cargo-harbor.exe`) and `LICENSE`. The layout is an interface, not a preference --
    `cargo binstall harbor` unpacks the archive and looks for the binary at its root,
    which is why `[package.metadata.binstall] bin-dir` in Cargo.toml has to spell that
    out; and MIT requires the licence notice to travel with a copy of the binary anyway.

    The name is an interface too, and a subtle one: `harbor-<target>` carries the
    **crate** name rather than the binary's (`cargo-harbor`, which Cargo's subcommand
    convention forces). The binary name only has to match `{ bin }` inside the archive.

    This script is what CI runs, so a release can be reproduced locally with one command.

.PARAMETER Target
    The target triple to build for, such as x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.

.PARAMETER OutDir
    Where the archive goes. Defaults to `dist`.
